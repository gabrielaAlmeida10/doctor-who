      <div>
        <p>
          "<b>The Doctor</b>", a title embodying their promise to the universe,
          was the main alias used by a mysterious time traveller of both space
          and time, seemingly a renegade Time Lord from Gallifrey. The Doctor
          adventured with numerous companions in an obsolete and "borrowed" Type
          40 TARDIS(Time and Relative Dimensions in Space). They were "the
          universe's greatest defender", having saved the cosmos thousands of
          times across a long life and becoming a legend throughout the
          universe, and a complicated space-time event of unparalleled
          complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Doctor is a largely believer in non-violent conflict resolution,
          trying always to resolve the problems in a pacific way. But, when
          absolutely necessary, they were a great warrior. Because of that, some
          civilisations in the universe, translate the word doctor as warrios,
          whilst other saw the Doctor as a compassionate benefactor, worthy of
          thei admitation and compassion.

          Survivior of the Last Great Time War, and believing he was the only
          one, the Ninth Doctor is living in grieving over the immense suffering
          he had witnessed and the destruction he had caused with his actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Struggling with the fact that he is the last of the Time Lords, The
          Doctor is now alone and bereaved. Emotionally haunted by the war, he
          entered a darker period of his life spattered by resentment, where he
          tended to brood and act rudely to those who rubbed him the wrong way,
          and found a particular rage towards the <b>Daleks</b>, that he
          believed to be desroyed whenever he encountered them. Despite this, he
          remained jovial and friendly towards anyone he took a liking to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always hoping for the best in every one, but never failing in showing
          his anger when they became a threat to innocent lives.

          Benefitting from the healing undergone by his predecessor, the Tenth
          Doctor possessed an outgoing, lively and genial demeanour that hid his
          underlying guilt, but it was still present and would appear if the
          Doctor was overwhelmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For most of his life, this incarnation was able to successfully
          project a convivial and even frivolous front. However, when he had to
          engage in conflict, the Doctor's energies would shift to reveal a
          fiercely protective man who resolutely guarded what he held dear, and
          who could be viciously unforgiving to the forces that dared menace
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was unique in that he was the only incarnation of the Doctor who
          chose to abort one of his regenerations, channelling the energy into
          his spare hand without changing his appearance, something his
          successor would attribute to suffering "vanity issues at the time".

        <span

          Explosive, exuberant, emotionally unpredictable and adventurous, the
          Eleventh Doctor was the last incarnation of the Doctor's original
          regenerative cycle. By this point in his life, the Doctor's reputation
          had grown immense, attracting a new strain of conflicts. Wishing to
          withdraw from the dangers it created, he became a secretive and
          guileful individual for the sake of himself and those he held close.
        </p>
        <p>
          This incarnation's most notable enemy was the Silence, who were
          responsible for destroying his TARDIS, causing the cracks in time,
          which eventually consumed the universe, though he restored it with the
          Pandorica. His multi-century war with the Silence critically involved
          companions Amy Pond, Rory Williams and their daughter, River Song.
          Ultimately, the most significant defeat of the Silence required him to
          marry River in a dubious wedding ceremony, albeit one they both seemed
          to regard as genuine.
