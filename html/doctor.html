        <p>
          "<b>The Doctor</b>", a title embodying their promise to the universe,
          was the main alias used by a mysterious time traveller of both space
          and time, seemingly a renegade Time Lord from Gallifrey. The Doctor
          adventured with numerous companions in an obsolete and "borrowed" Type
          40 TARDIS(Time and Relative Dimensions in Space). They were "the
          universe's greatest defender", having saved the cosmos thousands of
          times across a long life and becoming a legend throughout the
          universe, and a complicated space-time event of unparalleled
          complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Doctor is a largely believer in non-violent conflict resolution,
          trying always to resolve the problems in a pacific way. But, when
          absolutely necessary, they were a great warrior. Because of that, some
          civilisations in the universe, translate the word doctor as warrios,
          whilst other saw the Doctor as a compassionate benefactor, worthy of
          thei admitation and compassion.

          Survivior of the Last Great Time War, and believing he was the only
          one, the Ninth Doctor is living in grieving over the immense suffering
          he had witnessed and the destruction he had caused with his actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Struggling with the fact that he is the last of the Time Lords, The
          Doctor is now alone and bereaved. Emotionally haunted by the war, he
          entered a darker period of his life spattered by resentment, where he
          tended to brood and act rudely to those who rubbed him the wrong way,
          and found a particular rage towards the <b>Daleks</b>, that he
          believed to be desroyed whenever he encountered them. Despite this, he
          remained jovial and friendly towards anyone he took a liking to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always hoping for the best in every one, but never failing in showing
          his anger when they became a threat to innocent lives.
