        The Bootstrap Paradox is a Time Travel Paradox, in which the informations or objects can existis without been
        created. After a object - or information - be send back in time, it, recieved in the present, becames it self
        object or information that will be initialy taken back in time.

          "People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect,
          but actually, fom a nonlinear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's mora
          like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey...stuff" - 10th Doctor, Season 3 Episode 04 - Blink

      <p>The Bootstrap Paradox is a philosophical and logical issue that involves a circular self-reference. It relates
        to the problem of how to justify or substantiate a system of knowledge or beliefs when that system references
        itself for its for own validation.</p>
      <p>The Booststrap Paradox is often ilustrated through an imaginary story, such as the as the following:</p>
      <p>A time traveller who was a fan of Beethoven went into the past to meet his hero. However, he discovers that
        Beethoven doesn't exist. Then the traveller decides to publish all the works of Beethoven himself, thus becoming
        Beethoven. The confusing questions is: "Who composed Beethoven's Fifth?"</p>
      <p>The Booststrap Paradox raises questions about how we can justify our beliefs or knowledge systems when
        justification is based on circular references or self-reference. It highlights the complexity of the foundation
        of logical or epistemological systems and challenges the notion that we can always find a solid basis for our
        knowledge.</p>
      <h2>Examples in the show: </h2>
      <p><b>In season 2:</b> The Bad Wolf entity's existence was the result of a bootstrap paradox. Rose Tyler only looked into
        the heart of
        the TARDIS, creating the Bad Wolf, after she was motivated by seeing Bad Wolf graffiti, which she created after
        becoming the Bad Wolf herself</p>
      <p><b> season 3:</b> When the Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones found themselves stranded in 1969, the Doctor used a
        transcript that he'd been given by Sally Sparrow in 2008 to communicate with her past self in 2007. The
        conversation that Sally had with the Doctor led to the completion of Larry Nightingale's transcript allowing
        Sally to gift it to a version of the Tenth Doctor who had yet to encounter her so he could use it in 1969.</p>
      <p><b>In season 4:</b> Donna Noble created a bootstrap paradox by giving the idea of Miss Marple to Agatha Christie.
        Agatha got the
        idea of Miss Marple from Donna's knowledge of the future works by her. Although Agatha's memories of that night
        were wiped by her link with the Vespiform, the Tenth Doctor explains to Donna that some of the information may
        have "kept bleeding through... like Miss Marple".</p>
      <p><b>In season 6:</b> Amy Pond named her daughter, Melody Pond, after her childhood friend Mels, unaware that Mels was
        her daughter,
        making Melody her own namesake. Additionally, Melody started going by the name River Song after learning of her
        future identity from the Eleventh Doctor and her parents. </p>
