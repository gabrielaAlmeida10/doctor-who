          Donna Noble was a companion of the Tenth Doctor. Despite her humble
          beginnings, she was described by both Rose Tyler and the Tenth Doctor
          as being the most important woman in all of creation, due to the fact
          that she saved the whole of reality from the Daleks and Davros. To
          survive the side effects of her transformation into the "DoctorDonna",
          her memories of her time with the Doctor were forcibly erased and she
          was returned to Earth. She later married Shaun Temple and had a
          daughter.
        </p>
        <h3>My Opinion:</h3>
        <p>
          a wonderful companion for the Doctor. Always knowing the right time to
          advise him, always willing to help him, even putting herself in
          danger. Her personality on the outside may seem rude, largely because
          of her various traumas, but with those she cares about she knows how
          to be sweet and caring. One of the smartest companions he traveled
          with.

          Melody Pond's third incarnation, best known as Professor River Song,
          was a "child of the TARDIS" and the wife of the Doctor, specifically
          of their eleventh and twelfth incarnations, although she also had
          encounters with their tenth and thirteenth incarnations, as well as
          earlier incarnations whose memories were later redacted. She was
          mostly human, with some Time Lord DNA, and was conceived by her
          parents, Amy Pond and Rory Williams, aboard the TARDIS as it travelled
          through the Time Vortex. She was then raised and conditioned by the
          Silence, who used her unique DNA to transform her into the first of
          several Proto-Time Lords, granting her great strength, a deep
          understanding of the complex principles of time and space, and the
          ability to regenerate. She loved the Doctor dearly, and shared a
          long-lasting relationship with them. River was one of the very few
          people who knew the Doctor's true name.
        </p>
        <h3>My Opinion:</h3>
        <p>
          One of my favorite characters. River understood the Doctor, accepted
          him and loved him by the way he was. She knew him as no one knew, and
          was always trying her best to help him, when she could and the way she
          could. One of the most smartest character in the show also and with
          one of the most heartbreaking storylines and ending.

          Amelia Jessica Williams, (née Pond) more commonly known as Amy in her
          adulthood, was a companion of the Eleventh Doctor. She was nurse Rory
          Williams's girlfriend and later wife and the mother of Melody Pond,
          who later became known as River Song. Amy died aged eighty-seven at
          some point prior to 2012 after allowing a Weeping Angel to send her
          back in time, hoping to be reunited with her husband who had just been
          attacked by the same Angel. She was buried beside Rory in a graveyard
          in New York City.
        </p>
        <h3>My Opinion:</h3>
        <p>
          I liked her and how she was independent and brave, and I totally
          disagree with the people who says that she didn't love or didn't
          deserve Rory, throughout the series is very clear that she loves him
          on the same way that he loves her, she just express herself in a
          different way, but everybody does that. She is also very smart, manege
          to survive without the Doctor for year while was trapped in a place
          where everyone was basically trying to kill her.
        </p>
        <p>
          I just didn't like the way that she acts in the episode where they
          find River Song, after finding that she ir her daughter, River was
          clearly scared and she didn't show any worry with her.
