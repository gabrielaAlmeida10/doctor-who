      <p>Donna Temple-Noble (née Noble) was a companion of the Tenth Doctor.
        Despite her humble beginnings, she was described by both Rose Tyler and the Tenth Doctor as being the most
        important woman in all of creation, due to the fact that she saved the whole of reality from the Daleks and
        Davros. To survive the side effects of her transformation into the "DoctorDonna", her memories of her time with
        the Doctor were forcibly erased and she was returned to Earth. She later married Shaun Temple and had a
        daughter.</p>
      <h3>My Opinion:</h3>
      <p>a wonderful companion for the Doctor. Always knowing the right time to advise him, always willing to help him,
        even putting herself in danger.
        Her personality on the outside may seem rude, largely because of her various traumas, but with those she cares
        about she knows how to be sweet and caring. One of the smartest companions he traveled with.</p>
        <p>Managed to hold the mind of a time lord long enough to help defeat the dalek fleet and take 27 planets to their galaxies</p>
        <p>Is the most important woman in the whole universe.</p>
