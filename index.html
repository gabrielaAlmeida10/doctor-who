      <p>Doctor Who follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue Time Lord with
        somewhat unknown origins who goes by the name "the Doctor". The Doctor fled
        Gallifrey, the planet of the Time Lords, in a stolen TARDIS ("Time and Relative
        Dimension(s) in Space"), a time machine that travels by materialising into, and
        dematerialising out of, the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but
        appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a "chameleon circuit"
        intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a
        disguise. Due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue
        British police box.[7] Across time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations
        often find events that pique their curiosity, and try to prevent evil forces
        from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and
        minimal resources, such as the versatile sonic screwdriver. The Doctor rarely
        travels alone and is often joined by one or more companions on these adventures;
        these companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with
        planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international
        military task force UNIT when Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old
        and as a Time Lord, has the ability to regenerate when there is mortal damage to
        their body. The Doctor's various incarnations have gained numerous recurring
        enemies during their travels, including the Daleks, their creator Davros, the
        Cybermen, and the renegade Time Lord the Master.</p>
